# curV
A quick test of parametric curves in C. Might play around with some interfacing too.

## Installation
Just run `make` in the root of the repo to compile. It should make you an executable in the bin folder and a convenient little soft link in the root of the repo to run it.

## Cleanup
Just run `make clean` to clean up the repo as if you never built it.
