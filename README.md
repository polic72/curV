# curV
A quick test of parametric curves in C. Might play around with some interfacing too.

## Installation
Just run `make` in the root of the repo to compile. It should make you an executable in the bin folder and a convenient little soft link in the root of the repo to run it.

## Cleanup
Just run `make clean` to clean up the repo as if you never built it.

## Inspiration
This code is inspired by the RevitAPI, specifically the [Curve class](https://www.revitapidocs.com/2026/400cc9b6-9ff7-de85-6fd8-c20002209d25.htm) and [XYZ class](https://www.revitapidocs.com/2026/c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.htm). This is essentially an attempt to reverse engineer how it works, in hope of better understanding parametric curves and modeling engines in general.
